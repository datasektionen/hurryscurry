# schemas

JSON-schemas for the *drifters*, *events*, *missions* and *characters* data structures are stored in this directory. These schemas are used by the *jabbascript* program.

## Generate new schemas
JSON-schemas sucks to code by hand, use [this tool](https://jsonschema.net/#/editor) instead and copy paste into a file.
1. First make some mock data that follows the structure you want generated
2. Paste it into the **JSON\*** text area
3. Tick the *required* checkbox for **Object**
4. Untick the *Additional properties* checkbox for **Object**
5. Tick the *Additional items* checkbox for **Array**
6. Click **Generate Schema**
7. Profit **$$$**
